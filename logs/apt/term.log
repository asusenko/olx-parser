Everything you need to support STARTTLS (encrypted mail transmission
and user authentication via certificates) is installed and configured
but is *NOT* being used.

To enable sendmail to use STARTTLS, you need to:
1) Add this line to /etc/mail/sendmail.mc and optionally
   to /etc/mail/submit.mc:
  include(`/etc/mail/tls/starttls.m4')dnl
2) Run sendmailconfig

Updating /etc/hosts.allow, adding "sendmail: all".

Please edit /etc/hosts.allow and check the rules location to
make sure your security measures have not been overridden -
it is common to move the sendmail:all line to the *end* of
the file, so your more selective rules take precedence.

  All mail is sent to another machine, called a 'smarthost', for
  delivery.

The 'mail name' is the domain name used to 'qualify' _ALL_ mail addresses without a domain name. This includes mail to and from <root>:
please do not make your machine send out mail from root@example.org unless root@example.org has told you to.

This name will also be used by other programs. It should be the single, fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

The relayhost parameter specifies the default external host to send mail to when no entry is matched in the optional transport(5) table. When
